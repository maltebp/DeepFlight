# EXPLANATION OF RANKING ALGORITHM
#
# Summary:
#
#   for track in round.tracks:
#       rate track on times
#   rate round on tracks
#
#   rate universal on previous N rounds
#
# Track Rating:
#   Each user who has a time on the track (and thus played and finished the Track),
#   is ranked with best user being rank 1.
#   Each users' rating in then calculated by:
#
#       user rating = 1 - (rank-1)/(totalranks)
#
# Round Rating
#   Track Rating is calculated for each Track within the round
#   Each users Round Rating, is calculated by averaging combining Track Ratings
#
# Universal Rating
#   Each user's Universal Rating is calculated by averaging the 4 user's Round
#   Rating for N previous Rounds (N being a variable determined outside this)#


#
# Ranks the given round, based on the given tracks
